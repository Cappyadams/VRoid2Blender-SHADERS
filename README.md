## What is this?
This is a GitHub repository for my blender shaders made for VRoid models! All shaders come in one .blend file and are easy to use!
## Why make this?
Originally I made these shaders for my models. but then I realized that I was wasting a bit of time remaking the shaders each time or copy and pasting the nodes from a finished model. so I made a .Blend file for appending the shaders and I decided to share them with the world for those who want the same look to their models as mine!
## Does this require lots of blender knowledge?
Nope! These shaders don't require alot of blender knowledge! infact, All you need to know is how to use material nodes!
